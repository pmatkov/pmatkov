I'm studying software engineering at the University of Applied Sciences in Zagreb. 

After working as a lawyer I decided to switch tracks and pursue career in software engineering. 

I'm mostly interested in developing solid programming skills. Learning C in the first semester has been a valuable experience. I liked the simplicity and the power of the language and the fact that it is still used today after so many years. That is one path I would like to follow in the future, possibly combining that with embedded systems development. 

Of course, it is still probably too early to tell. I will see where my curriculum will take me and if I change my mind after I have a better grasp of the subjects ahead.
