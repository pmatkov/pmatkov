I hold a bachelorâ€™s degree in computing from the University of Applied Sciences in Zagreb.

I have previously worked as a lawyer, gaining experience in various legal fields, including real estate and capital markets. I am interested in combining my experience in computing with my background in law.

My primary interests include cybersecurity, data analytics, web applications and embedded systems. I am also a keen windsurfer and cyclist.
