I hold a bachelor’s degree in Computing from the University of Applied Sciences in Zagreb, as well as a master’s degree in Law from the Faculty of Law in Zagreb.

I previously worked as a lawyer, gaining experience across various legal fields, including real estate and capital markets. I am interested in combining my background in law with my skills in computing.

My primary interests include cybersecurity, data analytics, web applications and embedded systems.
