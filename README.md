I'm a final-year student of software engineering at the University of Applied Sciences in Zagreb. So far, I've been commended twice for achieving the best average grade in the department (4.8 and 4.9).

Previously, I have worked as a lawyer with a distinguished career in some of the top legal firms in Zagreb. I'm interested in connecting my current experience in software development with my legal profession background.

On the software development side, I'm primarily interested in cybersecurity, network applications and embedded systems. I have worked on several personal and class-related projects and gained experience in developing desktop apps, web apps, and using Git and databases. I have experience working with Linux administration tools. Additionally, I have taken optional courses in Embedded systems, PLC programming and Advanced JavaScript.

I'm a hard-working and motivated individual with a passion for the IT industry. I'm always looking to improve my skills and utilize my time efficiently.
