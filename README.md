I'm a student of software engineering at the University of Applied Sciences in Zagreb. 

After working as a lawyer, I decided to switch tracks and pursue career in software engineering. 

My main focus with this new path is developing solid programming skills. I like problem solving and programming fits here nicely because it's a challenging and rewarding mental exercise. Additionally, it offers the ability to think outside the box. 

As a freshman, I found C in the first semester a valuable learning experience. I liked the simplicity and the power of the language and the fact that it's still used today after so many years.

But I'm not just all about software. I also like creating and fixing things. I would like to use that DIY approach in embedded systems. So, software and embedded systems, that is where I see myself in the future, at least for now...
